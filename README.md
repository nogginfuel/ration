# Ration
An accessibility focused front-end framework that aims for WCAG 2.1 (Level AA) compliance. 

Ration's approach gives you the flexibility to use only the elements and styles (rations) you need, but allows you to easily use everything (Rucksack). The journey is long, so only take what you need.
